Rising Gate Calculator

This repository contains the source of the [Rising Gate Calculator](http://www.eversholt.org.uk/gates). 
The calculator has the advantage that it provides designs for the hinges of rising gates that allow the gate to sit vertical
in both the closed and the fully open positions. As far as I know, this is unique on the web. 
Please let me know if there's another instance.

It includes the calculator, the image files displayed on the web, and the photoshop files used to create the image files.
It also has the sketchup file used to create the photoshop files!

I release all of these files under an [MIT licence](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) - please fix my bugs. 
BUT be aware tha the sketchup data comes from two other people who may have different licences. I have been unable
to find their licence terms. The details are in the blog:

Don't forget, when you're in a muddy field in the rain with the sheep threatening to escape, 
that the last 0.01mm on the hinge position is critical :-)

Good Luck! Have Fun! Emrys
